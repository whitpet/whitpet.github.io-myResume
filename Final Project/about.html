<h1>A Step Into My World</h1>
<p class="bio">Growing up I would always hear the question, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" being asked.
     This seems like a simple question to answer, but I never knew.
     As I've grown, I've come to realize the answer to this question is not necessarily one specific thing, and it changes over time.
     As a junior Communication Studies major at Oklahoma Baptist University, I am seeking every day to be the person God wants me to be when I grow up.</p>

<p class="bio">I am active on my college campus through Canterbury, Hope House, Campus Activities Board, Residential Life, and Kappa Phi Beta. These organizations exist to serve the University and community through building relationships, hosting events, and other service projects.</p>

<p class="bio">Outside of school I enjoy traveling, guitar, music, and building community. Through my experiences both in school and life, I have learned the value of working alongside team to accomplish a specific goal. I am hard-working person and will utilize these skills and knowledge in the workplace.</p>
